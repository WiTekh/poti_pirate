## Gameplay
You play as a little pirate exploring an island, you have 2 minutes to find and take the treasure and to pickup as much objects as possible (including food/water/logs/cannonballs)to get ready for your trip back to your island. After the 2 minutes phase, you set sails to go back to your country.
The travel can be rude, water and food decreases over time and the shark attacks makes it difficult.
